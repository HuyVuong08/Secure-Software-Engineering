# Problem 1

## The Heartbleed Bug

In 2014, the Heartbleed bug (CVE-2014-0160) was disclosed as a critical vulnerability in the OpenSSL cryptographic library, which is widely used to in the internet communications. Attackers read the memory of the affected systems and retrive sensitive information such as private keys, usernames, passwords, and other personal data. The bug existed in the OpenSSL codebase for over two years before it is detected, which affects estimated 17% of web servers at that time. [heartbleed.com](https://heartbleed.com)

### Type of Failure: Implementation

Heartbleed is classified as an implementation failure. The vulnerability originated from a missing bounds check in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) heartbeat extension. By exploiting this, attackers requested more data than permitted, leading to the leakage of sensitive information from the server's database. The issue was not due to flaws in the TLS specification or the overall design of OpenSSL but resulted from a coding error during implementation.[csoonline.com](https://www.csoonline.com/article/562859/the-heartbleed-bug-how-a-flaw-in-openssl-caused-a-security-crisis.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Expert Analysis

Heartbleed hightlights the critical impact that software bugs can have on global cybersecurity. Heartbleed's vulnerbility is a zero-day (also known as a 0-day), which is a vulnerability in software or hardware that is typically unknown to the vendor and the vulnerbility was exploited for a period of time before it was discovered. Heartbleed left no traces in server logs, making it difficult for administrators to detect breaches or determine if sensitive data had been stolen. [heartbleed.com](https://heartbleed.com)

# Problem 2

### Scenario: Run the weekly Michigan Powerball lottery

#### Assumptions:

#### Assets:

-   Lottery tickets database for storing personal information of the lottery participants, lottery results, the total number of funds raised by selling lottery tickets.
-   The lottery drawing function: The lottery drawing function must be random and fair.
-   Winning numbers
-   Lottery website for selling lottery tickets and showing lottery results.
-   Lottery server for running the lottery draw function.

---

#### Threats:

-   DDoS attack on lottery server
-   Deface attack on lottery website
-   SQL injection attack on lottery database
-   Internal threat: For example, an employee of the lottery company can get access to the lottery drawing function and change the lottery results.
-   Fraud claim: A lottery participant can claim that he/she has won the lottery without actually winning it.

---

#### Countermeasures:

-   DDoS attack on lottery server

    -   Use a DDoS protection service like Cloudflare.
    -   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter out malicious traffic.
    -   Use a load balancer to distribute the traffic evenly.

-   Deface attack

    -   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent deface attacks.

-   SQL injection attack

    -   Prevent some special characters in the input fields.

-   Internal threat

    -   Have two seprate teams to test the drawing function to throughly test the lottery drawing function to ensure that it is random and fair.
    -   Limit the access to the lottery drawing function to a few people.

-   Fraud claim
    -   Throughly verify the lottery winners.

### Scenario: Oversee the football stadium at a Big Ten school

#### Assumptions:

#### Assets:

-   Key to the stadium's rooms
-   Stadium's equipments

---

#### Threats:

-   Theft of stadium's equipments
-   Unauthorized access to stadium's rooms
-   Vandalism and bomb threat

---

#### Countermeasures:

-   Theft of stadium's equipments

    -   Use security cameras to monitor the stadium.
    -   Use security guards to patrol the stadium.
    -   Use locks to secure the stadium's rooms.

-   Unauthorized access to stadium's rooms

    -   Use locks to secure the stadium's rooms.
    -   Use access control systems to limit access to authorized personnel only.

-   Vandalism and bomb threat

    -   Use security cameras to monitor the stadium.
    -   Use security guards to patrol the stadium.
    -   Use locks to secure the stadium's rooms
    -   Screening for weapons and other prohibited items is a common practice at many stadiums. This can be done with bag checks and metal detectors.

### Original Scenario: Mange the key database for BGSU campus

I am in charge of a key database for BGSU campus. I have to ensure that the key database is secure and that only authorized people have access to it. The key database store the information about physical keys (e.g: key ID, key bitting which could be used to create a copy of a key, information about the door lock, information of the people whom the key is issued to, etc.) to the campus's rooms.

#### Assets:

-   Key database for storing personal information of the key holders, key numbers, and the total number of keys issued.
-   Key to the campus's rooms
-   Buildings' map
-   Key planner for planning the key distribution

#### Threats:

-   Unauthorized access to the key database
-   The data being changed or deleted
-   Database being copied and leaked to the public
-   Key being issued to unauthorized people
-   Key being copied and leaked to the public
-   Key being lost or stolen
-   Key not being returned

#### Countermeasures:

-   Unauthorized access to the key database

    -   Use encryption to secure the key database. Also implement user access controls to ensure that only authorized people have access to the key database.

-   The data being changed or deleted

    -   Implement a backup system to prevent data loss.

-   Database being copied and leaked to the public

    -   Disable the copy function on the database to prevent data from being copied.

-   Key being issued to unauthorized people

    -   Implement verification process to ensure that only authorized people receive keys.

-   Key being copied and leaked to the public

    -   Change the key bitting regularly to prevent unauthorized key duplication.

-   Key being lost or stolen and Key not being returned

    -   Implement a warning system to notify the department who operates the room about the key not being returned or not being changed for a long time.
