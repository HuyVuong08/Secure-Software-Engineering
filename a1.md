# Problem 1

### Scenario: Blaster Worm

### Assumptions:

-   The Blaster Worm was a malware that exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows in 2003.
-   It spread rapidly across the internet, causing system crashes and network congestion.
-   The failure type was primarily implementation, as Microsoft failed to patch a known vulnerability in a timely manner.

### Assets:

-   System Availability – The worm caused widespread system crashes, disrupting businesses, governments, and home users.
-   Network Integrity – The worm generated massive amounts of malicious traffic, slowing down or disabling networks.
-   User Data and System Security – The worm allowed unauthorized remote access to infected systems, potentially exposing sensitive data.

---

### Threats:

-   Remote Code Execution (RCE) Exploit – The worm took advantage of a vulnerability in the Windows DCOM RPC interface, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely.
-   Self-Propagation – Once infected, a system would scan and attempt to infect other vulnerable computers, enabling rapid spread.
-   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks – The worm included a payload that attempted to launch a DoS attack on Microsoft’s update servers, hindering security patches.

---

### Countermeasures:

-   Timely Patch Deployment – Microsoft had released a patch for the vulnerability before the outbreak, but many systems remained unpatched. Organizations should enforce automated and timely updates.
-   Firewalls & Network Segmentation – Blocking unnecessary ports and segmenting networks could have limited the worm’s spread.
-   Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) – Early detection mechanisms could have identified and mitigated the worm before it spread globally.
-   User Awareness & Security Policies – Educating users and IT administrators on cybersecurity hygiene (e.g., applying updates and avoiding suspicious files) could reduce the risk of infections.

# Problem 2

### Scenario: Run the weekly Michigan Powerball lottery

#### Assumptions:

#### Assets:

-   Lottery tickets database for storing personal information of the lottery participants, lottery results, the total number of funds raised by selling lottery tickets.
-   The lottery drawing function: The lottery drawing function must be random and fair.
-   Winning numbers
-   Lottery website for selling lottery tickets and showing lottery results.
-   Lottery server for running the lottery draw function.

---

#### Threats:

-   DDoS attack on lottery server
-   Deface attack on lottery website
-   SQL injection attack on lottery database
-   Internal threat: For example, an employee of the lottery company can get access to the lottery drawing function and change the lottery results.
-   Fraud claim: A lottery participant can claim that he/she has won the lottery without actually winning it.

---

#### Countermeasures:

-   DDoS attack on lottery server

    -   Use a DDoS protection service like Cloudflare.
    -   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter out malicious traffic.
    -   Use a load balancer to distribute the traffic evenly.

-   Deface attack

    -   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent deface attacks.

-   SQL injection attack

    -   Prevent some special characters in the input fields.

-   Internal threat

    -   Have two seprate teams to test the drawing function to throughly test the lottery drawing function to ensure that it is random and fair.
    -   Limit the access to the lottery drawing function to a few people.

-   Fraud claim
    -   Throughly verify the lottery winners.

### Scenario: Oversee the football stadium at a Big Ten school

#### Assumptions:

#### Assets:

-   Key to the stadium's rooms
-   Stadium's equipments

---

#### Threats:

-   Theft of stadium's equipments
-   Unauthorized access to stadium's rooms
-   Vandalism
-   Bomb threat

---

#### Countermeasures:

-   Theft of stadium's equipments

    -   Use security cameras to monitor the stadium.
    -   Use security guards to patrol the stadium.
    -   Use locks to secure the stadium's rooms.

-   Bag Checks & Metal Detectors

    -   Screening for weapons and other prohibited items is a common practice at many stadiums. This can be done with bag checks and metal detectors.

-   Vandalism

    -   Use security cameras to monitor the stadium.
    -   Use security guards to patrol the stadium.
    -   Use locks to secure the stadium's rooms

-   Bomb threat

    -   Use security cameras to monitor the stadium.
    -   Use security guards to patrol the stadium.
    -   Use locks to secure the stadium's rooms
